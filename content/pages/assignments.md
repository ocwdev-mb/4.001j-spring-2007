Pre-NOLA Visit: A First Proposal Working Session
------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Synthesize a set of primary goals that your group has identified as essential to the future of New Orleans. These goals can be anything as long as you are convinced of their primacy. Describe each goal with one sentence. Write a short paragraph describing the relationship between these goals: symbiotic, contradictory, mutually exclusive, etc. **15-20 minutes**

Step 2: Now, define the scope of work that you believe would be required to bring about the goals you have identified. The work required should address key infrastructure and design issues while outlining the major political and social implications. **15-20 minutes**

Step 3: Finally, organize a presentation in which you state your goals, describe the work involved to reach those goals and describe the city as it would be after your proposals were accepted and implemented. Why would the city be a better place? **10 minutes**
